# Supplemental Notes for "Picture of Words"

## Purpose
This document serves as an addendum to my article, “Hands-on: Process visualization with generative AI” (German: [“Prozessvisualisierung mit generativer KI im Praxistest”](https://www.heise.de/ratgeber/Prozessvisualisierung-mit-generativer-KI-im-Praxistest-10266093.html?seite=all)), also to be published in iX magazine. It addresses the challenges of publishing a printed article in the fast-moving field of generative AI. Below is a list of noteworthy updates and developments relevant to the article. (The project name "Picture of Words" is German-inspired wordplay on the notion of drawing something with natural language, as a nod to using Frontier LLMs for technical diagramming).

## OpenAI EU Data Residency
> “With data residency, API customers can now choose to process data in Europe for eligible endpoints, and new ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu customers can choose to have customer content stored at rest in Europe.”

While API-based offerings provide better control, OpenAI’s introduction of data residency options for some subscription plans in Europe is a key development for organizations subject to stringent data protection regulations in the EU.

## Gemini 2.0 Revamped Pricing Scheme
Google’s new generative AI offering, Gemini 2.0, comes with a revised pricing model at Vertex AI. For details, see the [Google Vertex AI Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/pricing) page.

## Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet
Anthropic have released Claude 3.7 Sonnet - a hybrid model with optional Reasoning. [Announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet).

## OpenAI GPT-4.5 Preview
OpenAI have released GPT-4.5 in preview. This could make GPT-4 Turbo obsolete. [Announcement](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/)

## OpenAI Playground renamed to Prompts Playground
platform.openai.com is "Prompts Playground" now. [Announcement](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1900358343333482861)

## OpenAI have added PDF support to Prompts Playground an API
Prompts Playground and OpenAI now support PDFs. This seems to work better than some of the "Text only" LLM frontends featured in my article, but there are limits as well: 100 pages, 32 MB. [Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files?api-mode=chat)

*Additional updates will be appended here as this fast-evolving field continues to develop.*
