# Supplemental Notes for "Picture of Words"

## Purpose
This document serves as an addendum to my article, “Hands-on: Process visualization with generative AI” (German: [“Prozessvisualisierung mit generativer KI im Praxistest”](https://www.heise.de/ratgeber/Prozessvisualisierung-mit-generativer-KI-im-Praxistest-10266093.html?seite=all)), also to be published in iX magazine. It addresses the challenges of publishing a printed article in the fast-moving field of generative AI. Below is a list of noteworthy updates and developments relevant to the article. (The project name "Picture of Words" is German-inspired wordplay on the notion of drawing something with natural language, as a nod to using Frontier LLMs for technical diagramming).

## OpenAI EU Data Residency
> “With data residency, API customers can now choose to process data in Europe for eligible endpoints, and new ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu customers can choose to have customer content stored at rest in Europe.”

While API-based offerings provide better control, OpenAI’s introduction of data residency options for some subscription plans in Europe is a key development for organizations subject to stringent data protection regulations in the EU.

## Gemini 2.0 Revamped Pricing Scheme
Google’s new generative AI offering, Gemini 2.0, comes with a revised pricing model at Vertex AI. For details, see the [Google Vertex AI Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/pricing) page.

*Additional updates will be appended here as this fast-evolving field continues to develop.*
